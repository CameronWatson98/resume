<ul class="tree">
  <p>
    <li>Achievements and responsibilities (in order):</li>
  <ul class="incremental">
    <li>
      <p>Spearheaded the automation of PLC code generation with an in-house C# desktop application, reducing engineer
        coding time and accelerating project delivery timelines by months.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Developed features for, and maintained, a Flutter app which
        controls
        and digitises data from lab equipment using gRPC.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> As part of a project bid, I designed,
        developed a prototype, and presented a cross-platform Flutter
        application for
        use in the health and safety sector.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> Developed a Flutter desktop application, which provided live
        data
        oversight and control of various scientific instruments and the results of
        algorithms which analysed their data. The frontend
        interfaced with a Python
        server on the backend and uploaded results to Azure Blob
        Storage.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Designed screens, and developed a Flutter application, which
        allowed users to manage and operate Autonomous Mobile Robots
        (AMRs)
        from a tablet. The backend was written in Go, which collated and
        uploaded AMR data to Pocketbase (an SQLite-based backend
        service).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Recently a decent part of my responsibilities has been mentoring
        two
        apprentices, one at college level and the other at university
        level
        respectively. I've overseen their learning of Flutter mainly and
        also helped manage an in-house project that they've been assigned.
        This has a Flutter frontend, which I designed and provided as part
        of the project spec for them to develop.</p>
