    <p>
      Due to being hired by a different department initially, my
      responsibilities and, as a result, the tech stack, have changed
      throughout my employment. After about a year, I expressed my
      interest in picking up some Flutter and design-related tasks in my
      downtime, which eventually led to the move from AI's Defence
      department to AST. Although, my work has predominantly revolved
      around application development of some sort throughout.

    <ul class="tree">
      <p>
        <li>Achievements and responsibilities (in order):</li>
        <ul class="incremental">
          <li><p>Created and maintained an in-house C# desktop application that
              generated PLC code. The existing workflow would include an
              engineer
              writing code by hand which could take weeks/months to
              complete.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Developed features for, and maintained, a Flutter app which
              controls
              and digitises data from lab equipment using gRPC.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p> As part of a project bid, I designed,
              developed a prototype, and presented a cross-platform Flutter
              application for
              use in the health and safety sector.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p> Developed a Flutter desktop application, which provided live
              data
              oversight and control of various instruments and the results of
              algorithms which analysed their data. The frontend
              interfaced with a Python
              server on the backend and uploaded results to Azure Blob
              Storage.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Designed screens, and developed a Flutter application, which
              allowed users to manage and operate Autonomous Mobile Robots
              (AMRs)
              from a tablet. The backend was written in Go, which collated and
              uploaded AMR data to Pocketbase (an SQLite-based backend
              service).</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Recently a decent part of my responsibilities has been mentoring
              two
              apprentices, one at college level and the other at university
              level
              respectively. I've overseen their learning of Flutter mainly and
              also helped manage an in-house project that they've been assigned.
              This has a Flutter frontend, which I designed and provided as part
              of the project spec for them to develop.</p>
